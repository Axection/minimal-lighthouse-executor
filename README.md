# Minimal Lighthouse Runner Template

This repo includes a very minimal lighthouse runner via typescript `ts-node`. To run, just execute `yarn start`.

## Getting started

Take a look into `index.ts`, and modify the these two to suit your needs

```typescript
const url = 'https://www.google.com';
const chromePath = '\\chromium\\chrome.exe'; // or usually /usr/bin/chromium-browser
```

## Contribute

Feel free to post `issues`, or suggest things via `pull request`

## Notes

This template uses `yarn 2 berry` + `PnP`.
